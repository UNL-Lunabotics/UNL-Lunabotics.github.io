## Gazebo

This folder will contain all the information necessary to get a Gazebo simulation working. It assumes you already know how to make a URDF and will just specify when certain actions need to occur. If you don't know how to make a proper URDF, see the URDF folder. It will include details on making an SDF or .world file.
