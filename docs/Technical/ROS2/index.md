## ROS2

This section will contain information on aspects of a lot of ROS2. This will include library dependencies such as Nav2 or ROS2 Control. It should have more in depth information than anything found in Curriculum and include code snippets explaining how to do certain things. It should also include information flows and how to manage a large ROS2 system. Everything in this section should inform you on how to build a complete and working ROS2 robot.

**This folder assumes you have a basic understanding of these concepts and need to know the concrete implementation details. If you do not, go visit the curriculum.**

Its subfolders will be organized into the respective information for that ROS2 distribution (such as Jazzy, Humble, etc).
