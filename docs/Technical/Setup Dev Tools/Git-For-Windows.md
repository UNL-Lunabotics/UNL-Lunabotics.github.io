# Git For Windows

{: .note }
This is **ONLY** needed for Windows. If you are on macOS or Linux, continue to [Installing Docker]({% link docs/Technical/Setup Dev Tools/Installing-Docker.md %})

Git is needed to clone the repository needed. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/install/windows), and run the installer. Note that there are a lot of prompts, but just keep selecting "Next" and use the recommended settings. You do not need to open Git Bash once installed.
