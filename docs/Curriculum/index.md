# Curriculum Introduction

If you are brand new to the programming subteam, it will be best to start at [Learning ROS2]({% link docs/Curriculum/Learning-ROS2.md %})

Once you finish with that, it is recommended that you start tackling some of the more difficult concepts like tf2 and URDF. Please note that <u>most of the guides in here are conceptual</u> with a few examples. If you want detailed tutorials on how to do something, you will probably find better information in [Technical Documentation]({% link docs/Technical/index.md %})
