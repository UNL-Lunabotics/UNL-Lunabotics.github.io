# VSCode Setup

I think that it is significantly easier to edit this Github Pages in VSCode than it is in the browser. I have set up the repository to be VSCode friendly and even set up some custom settings, a linter, and GitHub Pull Request support

You can clone the repository locally with `git clone https://github.com/UNL-Lunabotics/unl-lunabotics.github.io`

After cloning it, you will be prompted to download the recommended extensions for the workspace. I highly recommend saying yes as it includes the linter that helps keep our formatting consistent, and it also includes some helpful markdown tools

Right now pull requests are not being utilized, but maybe in the future we will require them.
