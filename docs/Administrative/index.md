This section will mostly include documents on how to maintain the programming subteam as a whole and also this wiki. This will be most useful for the programming lead and lead apprentice. However, this will include some documents that will be useful for all members (VSCode Setup, for example). If you are a general programming member, it is recommended to give a brief look through the titles of all the pages and decide which ones interest you
