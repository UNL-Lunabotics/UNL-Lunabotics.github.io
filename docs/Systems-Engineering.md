# Systems Engineering Intro

This is where information specifically for systems engineering will be kept. It will include things like diagrams, justification for certain decisions, design gates, and whatever else needs to be done

It will be a good reference for both non-programmers who would like to know a little more about what's going on, and members of the programming subteam who would like a more high level overview of what the whole subteam is doing
