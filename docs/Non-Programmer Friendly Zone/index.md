## Non-Programmer Friendly Zone Intro

This will primarily consist of high level overview and simplified tutorials for anyone looking to learn a little more about programming. It will include resources for how to learn your first programming language, as well as understand the basic structure of our programming architecture.

Most importantly, it will include tutorials on how to do things that programming will need from the mechanical teams. For example, we will need URDF files for every major part of the robot, so there will be a tutorial here on how to convert from STL -> URDF.

It will also include a glossary to explain whatever nonsense programmers are talking about!

Before anything else, I recommend that you go straight to [Introduction to Programming]({% link docs/Non-Programmer Friendly Zone/Introduction-to-Programming.md %}) if you have minimal or no exposure to programming, OR if you want to find links for resources on learning how to program.
