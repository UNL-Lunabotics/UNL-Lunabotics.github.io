# All About LiPo Batteries

## What Are LiPos

## Risks of Using LiPos
Don't have the battery get too low! The voltage is exponential, once you get to like 9.5V the battery voltage will drop QUICK. Keep the lipos at 10 or above to avoid this.

## Charging LiPos
If the 11.1 V LiPo is new, perfectly used, and never messed up, then you can charge at 2A. 
Since most, if not all of our lipos have been messed up, make sure to be especially careful with them!

### Standard Charging

### Charging From **Lower** Voltage
