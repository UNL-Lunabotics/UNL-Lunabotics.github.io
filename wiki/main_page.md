# Welcome to the UNL Lunabotics Documentation Site

This is documentation for team processes and code that we can keep over the years as a great reference. The source code was provided by [Drassil Git Wiki](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki).

We will include documentation for our test robot (Terrence) and competition robot (Tabitha 2023, Theodore 2022). We will also include any results of research and explanations of our code.
